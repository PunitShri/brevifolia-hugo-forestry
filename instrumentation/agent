Agent and Gateway Connectivity
Agents and Gateways need outbound network connectivity to the OpsRamp Cloud. See options below.
Inbound connectivity requirements: OpsRamp Gateway needs an inbound port 3128 opened for Proxy connections from the agents.
The Agent and Gateway need DNS access to resolve *.api.opsramp.com If your organization has firewall policies to limit outbound access to specific IP addresses, then the Agent and Gateway must have access to the OpsRamp IP addresses below.
Agents works with any standard HTTP Proxy. OpsRamp recommends Squid: http://www.squid-cache.org/
